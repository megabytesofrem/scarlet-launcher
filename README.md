# thcrap-linux
Graphical Linux wrapper around the Touhou Community Reliant Automatic Patcher. 
It automatically sets up a wine prefix and downloads thcrap and displays your games in a pretty list.

## Usage
Launch `thcrap.desktop`. `legacy.sh` is the legacy command line UI and is not recommended anymore.

## Requirements
The only packages required as `pyqt6`, `rich` and of course `wine`. 
thcrap-linux will handle creating and setting up winetricks and its dependencies automatically ðŸª„.
