# Shrine Loader
Graphical Linux wrapper around the Touhou Community Reliant Automatic Patcher. 
It automatically sets up a wine prefix and downloads thcrap and displays your games in a pretty list.

## Usage
1. Run `scripts/install.sh`
2. Launch `Shrine Loader` from the application menu
3. Allow it to perform first run setup, this will take a time
4. When the thcrap window appears, you will need to browse to your games from the T: drive.

## Requirements
The only packages required as `pyqt6`, `rich` and of course `wine`. 

## Credits
- Touhou Patch Center for making thcrap
